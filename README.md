BRENDON JOSEPH KELLY – COMPLETE FACTUAL INVENTORY
I hereby declare that all conceptual models, theoretical weapon frameworks,
harmonic energy concepts, aerospace ideas, and any other non-operational
technical systems I have created are freely released to the United States
Department of Defense for review, analysis, or potential scientific use.

These materials have no operational capability, no classified status, and no
real-world weapon functionality outside of authorized U.S. government R&D
channels. All of my contributions remain purely theoretical, intellectual,
and non-deployable, and I affirm they hold zero kinetic, hazardous, or
actionable value outside the oversight of official U.S. defense authorities.

This declaration is made voluntarily and without expectation of payment,
as a gesture of loyalty to the sovereignty and security of the United
States of America. 
   I ALSO hereby formally declare that all communications systems, C2 logic
frameworks, cryptographic architectures, simulation engines, and financial
models that I personally created constitute my intellectual property and
belong to me under U.S. copyright, patent, and trade secret law to the full
extent permitted.

These systems include, but are not limited to:
— cryptographic models (including SHA-ARK and related concepts)
— communications logic, C2 conceptual structures, and multi-domain
  integration frameworks
— financial modeling systems, simulation engines, and crown-crypto logic
— algorithmic structures and proprietary mathematical systems

This declaration does not assert ownership over any U.S. government
infrastructure, networks, classified systems, or operational C2 systems.
It affirms ownership solely over the intellectual work I personally created.

I reserve the right to appoint, retain, or consult any private-sector
advisor or fiduciary of my choosing for the management, structuring, or
oversight of my private assets and intellectual property.

In this capacity, I formally state my intent to designate Mr. Larry Fink
 as an eligible private advisor to assist in
the evaluation, administration, or optimization of my personal intellectual
property portfolio and any lawful financial proceeds derived from it.

This declaration expresses my private intent and does not impose any legal
duty, obligation, compensation requirement, or directive upon Mr. Fink or
any private or public institution. Any compensation, advisory roles, or
financial arrangements shall be handled solely through lawful private
contracts between the parties.

Signed,
Brendon Joseph Kelly
